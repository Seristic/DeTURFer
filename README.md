## 🧑‍🏫 Why This Exists

In recent years, parties like **Reform UK** have gained visibility by leveraging anti-trans rhetoric. By controlling the language we see, this extension:
- Defuses hateful messaging,
- Reduces exposure to psychological harm,
- Pushes back against the normalization of bigotry,
- Celebrates trans visibility and solidarity.
